# Lobbyist Example Project
This is the C++ version of the [Lobbyist](https://minifloppy.it/tools/lobbyist/) example project (for Unreal Engine 4.24 and up). It leverages Lobbyist to implement a fully featured lobby system, including:

- A server browser from which players can create new lobbies and join existing ones.
- A multiplayer lobby featuring a chat system, character selection, player kicking, ping visualization and more.
- Traveling to the actual game and getting back to the lobby once the game is over.

The example project is implemented in C++ and UMG and can be easily used as a base for your own lobby. A [standalone demo version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/buuf3ab9kzuedyu/LobbyistDemo.zip?raw=1) of this project is available for download.
